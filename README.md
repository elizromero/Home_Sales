This project demonstrates the use of SparkSQL for large-scale data analysis, emphasizing efficient data processing techniques such as caching, partitioning, and using temporary views. The results and comparisons between cached, uncached, and partitioned data illustrate the impact of Spark optimization techniques on query performance.
